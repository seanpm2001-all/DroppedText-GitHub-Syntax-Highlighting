- test your changes on [Lightshow](https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com),
- generate the [`DroppedText.tmLanguage`](DroppedText.tmLanguage) file using [this script](https://github.com/asciidoctor/sublimetext-asciidoc/blob/master/script/yaml-to-plist),
- commit and push your changes (or send a pull request to this repository),
- wait patiently for the next release and deployment of linguist on GitHub, the changes here will be taken into account automatically.
